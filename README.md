# A Tom MySpace clone coded in next/react/css modules/scss

The github link is behind the MySpace NavBar Brand "MySpace"

There is still work to be done on the Navbar
: centering links,
: fixing the scrolling off screen when this many links conflict
with the smaller screen sizes before the "hamburger" drop-down
kicks in. Maybe double bank the nav for this situation?

# Installation:

either yarn or npm install to reconstitute npm_modules folder.

# Run:

npm run dev from visual code terminal.

App will be available on localhost/3000
